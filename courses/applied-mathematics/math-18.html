          <h5>Course Description</h5>
          <p>
            MATH 18 (Precalculus Mathematics) is one of the foundation courses offered by the
            Division of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. This serves as a prerequisite course to
            MATH 53 (Calculus I). The goal of this course is for the students to develop
            higher-level precalculus skills that will better prepare them to undertake the series of
            calculus courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this course, we will cover some preliminary topics on the real number system and
            properties of the set of real numbers. We will then discuss algebraic and transcendental
            functions, systems of equations and inequalities, and the conics and other plane curves.
            The detailed outline of topics is presented on the next page of this guide. This course
            might have a long coverage but studying all these topics will be of great help in
            building a strong foundation in basic mathematical skills. Not only it will equip you
            with essential arithmetic skills, but also it will help you hone your critical thinking
            and problem-solving abilities by applying your learning in some real-world scenarios.
          </p>

          <h5>Course Learning Outcomes</h5>
